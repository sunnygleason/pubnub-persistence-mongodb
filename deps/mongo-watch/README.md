# Mongo Watch

This watcher ties into the MongoDB replication log (local.oplog.rs) by default, but you can also tie into local.oplog.$main on a master DB. It then notifies your watchers any time the data changes.

In order to use this you must:

*replication log*

1. Have access to the oplog.  This will not be available on shared DB hosting, as it would reveal everyone else's database transactions to you.
2. Have replication enabled.  This can be done by starting mongod with the option `--replSet someArbitraryName`.  You must then call `rs.initiate()` from the mongo CLI.

*master log*

1. Have access to the oplog.  This will not be available on shared DB hosting, as it would reveal everyone else's database transactions to you.
2. Start your mongod as `--master`.
3. Use: `new MongoWatch({useMasterOplog:true})`

The watcher is fairly low latency and overhead.  On my machine a test with a single insert and watcher takes 20ms.  The cursor used to tail the oplog is being initialized with {awaitdata: true} so the data should be getting pushed from MongoDB's internal mechanism, instead of polling.

Because the watcher ties in to the oplog, this solution should scale with you as you add more MongoDB nodes, and allow any corresponding application instances to be notified of the same state changes.  I have not yet set up a cluster to test this, so I would welcome any comments or feedback you might have.

Happy event driven programming!  8-)

**Note:** The query functionality previously supported in 0.1.12 is now deprecated.  This code will be moved to [Particle](https://github.com/torchlightsoftware/particle).  Sorry for any inconvenience, but I determined this would be a much cleaner place to separate the APIs and respective responsibilities of the libraries.

## Install

```bash
npm install mongo-watch
```

## Usage

Watching a collection is as easy as:

```coffee-script
MongoWatch = require 'mongo-watch'

watcher = new MongoWatch {format: 'pretty'}

# watch the collection
watcher.watch 'test.users', (event) ->

  # parse the results
  console.log 'something changed:', event
```

Now when you run an insert you should see the event get logged by the code above.

```coffee-script
# create db client for a test transaction
{Server, Db} = require 'mongodb'
client = new Db 'test', new Server('localhost', 27017), {w: 1}
client.open ->
  client.collection 'users', (err, users) ->

    # fire off an update that will trigger the watcher
    users.insert {email: 'graham@daventry.com'}, ->
```

## Options

See the applyDefaults function in [lib/main.coffee](https://github.com/TorchlightSoftware/mongo-watch/blob/master/lib/main.coffee) for a list of options and their defaults.

See the tests for more examples.

## Authentication

Pass the "username" and "password" options.

```coffee
watcher = new MongoWatch {username: 'bobross', password: 'happytrees'}
```

## Debugging

If you pass the onDebug option with a function of your choice, it will be notified of major events in the listener lifecycle.  This is useful for troubleshooting if you're not receiving the notifications you expect.

```coffee
watcher = new MongoWatch {onDebug: console.log}
```

For reference, here is output taken from the test 'Mongo Watch - insert should emit an event'.  You should expect an output similar to this, and if it's breaking down you should be able to see why from the last event that was fired.  Are you listening to the right collection?

```bash
Ready: false
Emiting 'connected'. Stream exists: true
Adding emitter for: { collection: 'test.users' }
Adding listener on: { collection: 'test.users' }
Data changed: { data:
   { ts: { _bsontype: 'Timestamp', low_: 1, high_: 1362553757 },
     h: { _bsontype: 'Long', low_: -1091839621, high_: 386723518 },
     op: 'i',
     ns: 'test.users',
     o: { email: 'graham@daventry.com', _id: 5136eb9d19bd55597e000001 } },
  watching: 'test.users',
  relevant: true }
Emitting event: { channel: 'change:test.users',
  event:
   { ts: { _bsontype: 'Timestamp', low_: 1, high_: 1362553757 },
     h: { _bsontype: 'Long', low_: -1091839621, high_: 386723518 },
     op: 'i',
     ns: 'test.users',
     o: { email: 'graham@daventry.com', _id: 5136eb9d19bd55597e000001 } } }
Removing listeners for: test.users
```

[Kristina Chodorow](http://www.kchodorow.com/blog/2010/10/12/replication-internals/) was very helpful both in documenting the oplog in her blog posts, and in answering some of my questions.  Christian Kvalheim's [code](https://github.com/christkv/realtime/blob/master/lib/app/dataproviders/flow_data_provider.js) served as the basis for the cursor connection.
